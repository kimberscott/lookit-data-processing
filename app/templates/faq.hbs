                <div>
                    <p>
                        Cognitive development is the science of what kids understand and how they learn. Researchers in
                        cognitive development are interested in questions like...
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>what knowledge and abilities infants are born with, and what they have to learn from
                            experience
                        </li>
                        <li>how abilities like mathematical reasoning are organized and how they develop over time</li>
                        <li>what strategies children use to learn from the wide variety of data they observe</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        A study is meant to answer a very specific question about how children learn or what they know:
                        for instance, "Do three-month-olds recognize their parents' faces?"

                <div>
                    <p>
                        If you have any children between 3 months and 7 years old and would like to participate,
                        create an account and take a look at what we have available for your child's age range.
                        You'll need a working webcam to participate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you select a study, you'll be asked to read a consent form and record yourself stating that
                        you and your child agree to participate. Then we'll guide you through what will happen during
                        the study. Depending on your child's
                        age, your child may answer questions directly or we may be looking for indirect signs of what
                        she thinks is going on--like how long she looks at a surprising outcome.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some portions of the study will be automatically recorded using your webcam and sent securely to
                        our MIT lab. Trained researchers will watch the video and record your child's responses--for
                        instance, which way he pointed, or how long she looked at each image. We'll put these together
                        with responses from lots of other children to learn more about how kids think!

            {{#bs-accordion-item title='How do we provide consent to participate?'}}
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Rather than having the parent or legal guardian sign a form, we ask that you read aloud
                        (or sign in ASL) a statement of consent which is recorded using your webcam and sent back
                        to our lab. This statement holds the same weight as a signed form, but should be less hassle
                        for you. It also lets us verify that you understand written English and that you understand
                        you're being videotaped.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we receive a consent form that does
                        NOT clearly demonstrate informed consent--for instance, we see a parent and child but the
                        parent does not read the statement--any other video collected during that session will be deleted
                        without viewing.

                        We do not publish or use identifying information about individual children or families. We never

                        are at the time of the study). Your video is transmitted over a secure https connection to our
                        lab and kept on a password-protected server. See 'Who will see our video?'

                        Trained MIT researchers who have been approved to work on the "Lookit" project will watch the
                        video segments you send to mark down information specific to the study--for instance, what your
                        child said, or how long he/she looked to the left versus the right of the screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether anyone else may view the video depends on the privacy settings you select at the end of
                        the study. There are two decisions to make: whether to allow your data to be used by the Lookit
                        team only or to share with Databrary, and how to allow your video clips to be used by the researchers
                        you have selected.
                    </p>
                    <p> First, we ask if you would like to share your data (including video) with authorized
                        users fo the secure data library Databrary. Data sharing will lead to faster progress in
                        research on human development and
                        behavior. Researchers who are granted access to the Databrary
                        library must agree to treat the data with the same high standard of
                        care they would use in their own laboratories.

                    <p>
                        Next, we ask what types of uses of your video are okay with you.

                            and, if you have opted to share your data with Databrary, authorized Databrary users.)
                             We will view the
                            videos to record information about what your child did during the study--for instance,
                            looking for 9 seconds at one image and 7 seconds at another image.

                            For example, we might show a video clip in a talk at a scientific conference or an undergraduate
                            class about cognitive development, or include an image or video in a scientific paper. In some
                            circumstances, video or images may be available online, for instance as supplemental material in a
                            scientific paper. Sharing videos with other researchers helps other groups trust and build on our
                            work.

                            instance, we might post a short video clip on the Lookit website, on our Facebook page,
                            or in a press release. Your video will never be used for commercial purposes.

                        do not share with Databrary. Participants also have the option to withdraw all video
                        besides consent at the end of the study if necessary (for instance, because someone was discussing state secrets
                        in the background). Privacy settings for completed sessions cannot be changed retroactively.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        For children under about two years old, we usually design our studies to let their eyes do the
                        talking! We're interested in where on the screen your child looks and/or how long your child
                        looks at the screen rather than looking away. Our calibration videos (example shown below)
                         help us get an idea of what
                        it looks like when your child is looking to the right or the left, so we can code the rest of
                        the video.
                    </p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3">

                        Here's an example of a few children watching our calibration video--it's easy to
                        see that they look to one side and then the other.

                        <div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3">

                        Your child's decisions about where to look can give us
                        lots of information about what he or she understands. Here are some of the techniques our lab
                        uses to learn more about how children learn.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Habituation</h4>
                    <p>
                        In a habituation study, we first show infants many examples of one type of object or event, and
                        they lose interest over time. Infants typically look for a long time at the first pictures, but
                        then they start to look away more quickly. Once their looking times are much less than they were
                        initially, we show either a picture from a new category or a new picture from the familiar
                        category. If infants now look longer to the novel example, we can tell that they understood--and
                        got bored of--the category we showed initially.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Habituation requires waiting for each individual infant to achieve some threshold of
                        "boredness"--for instance, looking half as long at a picture as he or she did initially.
                        Sometimes this is impractical, and we use familiarization instead. In a familiarization study,
                        we show all babies the same number of examples, and then see how interested they are in the
                        familiar versus a new category. Younger infants and those who have seen few examples tend to
                        show a familiarity preference--they look longer at images similar to what they have seen before.
                        Older infants and those who have seen many examples tend to show a novelty preference--they look
                        longer at images that are different from the ones they saw before. You probably notice the same
                        phenomenon when you hear a new song on the radio: initially you don't recognize it; after it's
                        played several times you may like it and sing along; after it's played hundreds of times you
                        would choose to listen to anything else.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Violation of expectation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Infants and children already have rich expectations about how events work. Children (and adults
                        for that matter) tend to look longer at things they find surprising, so in some cases, we can
                        take their looking times as a measure of how surprised they are.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Preferential looking</h4>
                    <p>
                        Even when they seem to be passive observers, children are making lots of decisions about where
                        to look and what to pay attention to. In this technique, we present children with a choice
                        between two side-by-side images or videos, and see if children spend more time looking at one of
                        them. We may additionally play audio that matches one of the videos. The video below shows a
                        participant looking to her left when asked to "find clapping"; the display she's watching is shown
                        at the top.
                    </p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3">
                        {{ivy-videojs src="/assets/video//mp4/clapping.mp4" controls=true}}
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Predictive looking</h4>
                    <p>
                        Children can often make sophisticated predictions about what they expect to see or hear next.
                        One way we can see those predictions in young children is to look at their eye movements. For
                        example, if a child sees a ball roll behind a barrier, he may look to the other edge of the
                        barrier, expecting the ball to emerge there. We may also set up artificial predictive
                        relationships--for instance, the syllable "da" means a toy will appear at the left of the
                        screen, and "ba" means a toy will appear at the right. Then we can see whether children learn
                        these relationships, and how they generalize, by watching where they look when they hear a
                        syllable.
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>
                        Older children may simply be able to answer spoken questions about what they think is happening.
                        For instance, in the "Learning from Others" study we ran last year, two women call an
                        object two different made-up names, and children are asked which is the correct name for the
                        object.

                        Another way we can learn about how older children (and adults) think is to measure their
                        reaction times. For instance, we might ask you to help your child learn to press one key when a
                        circle appears and another key when a square appears, and then look at factors that influence
                        how quickly they press a key.

                        Traditionally, developmental studies happen in a quiet room in a university lab. Researchers
                        call or email local parents to see if they'd like to take part and schedule an appointment for
                        them to come visit the lab. Why complement these in-lab studies with online ones? We're hoping
                        to...

                        The process of publishing a scientific study, from starting data collection to seeing the paper in a journal,
                        can take several years. You can check the Lookit home page for updates on papers, or set your communication
                        preferences to be notified when we have results from studies you participated in.

                    <p>
                        Certainly--thanks for your dedication! You may see a warning that you have already participated
                        in the study when you go to try it again. You don't need to tell us that you tried the
                        study before; we'll have a record of your previous participation.

                        you're welcome to try the study anyway. If your child is just below the minimum age for a study,
                        however, we encourage you to wait so that we'll be able to use the data.

                        For study eligibility, we usually use the child's chronological age (time since birth), even for
                        premature babies. We ask for the child's gestational age at birth when you register a child so that
                        we can also use the adjusted age in our analysis. If adjusted age is important for a particular study,
                        we will make that clear in the study description.

                        Sure! Right now, instructions for children and parents are written only in English, so some
                        of them may be confusing to a child who does not hear English regularly. However, you're welcome
                        to try any of the studies and translate for your child if you can. If it matters for the study
                        whether your child speaks any languages besides English, we'll ask specifically. You can also
                        indicate the languages your child speaks or is learning to speak on your demographic survey.

                        Of course! We're interested in how all children learn and grow. If you'd like, you can make a
                        note of any developmental disorders in the comments section at the end of the study. Any health
                        information provided will be kept confidential. We are excited that in the future, online
                        studies may help more families participate in research to better understand their own children's
                        diagnoses.

                        One note: most of our studies include both images and sound, and may be hard to understand if
                        your child is blind or deaf. If you can, please feel free to help out by describing images or

                        If possible, we ask that each child participate separately. When children participate together
                        they generally
                        influence each other. That's a fascinating subject in its own right but usually not the focus
                        of our research.

                        that children learn best from people, not screens! However, our studies are not intended to
                        educate children, but to learn from them.

                        As part of a child's limited screen time, we hope that our studies will foster family
                        conversation and engagement with science that offsets the few minutes spent watching a video
                        instead of playing. And we do "walk the walk"--our own young children (okay, mostly Kim's son
                        Remy) provide lots of feedback on our studies before we make them available to you!

                        For some studies, yes! Usually, we only interpret children's abilities and developmental
                        trends at a group level, so the individual data collected just isn't very interpretable.
                        But for "Baby physics" and other longitudinal studies (where we ask you to come back
                        for more than one session), we'll be collecting enough data to give you a
                        report of your child's responses after you complete all the sessions. Because this is a
                        fairly labor-intensive process (we generally have two undergraduates watch each video and
                        record where your child is looking each frame, and then we do some analysis to create a
                        summary), it may take us several weeks to produce your report.
                     </p> <p>
                        Please note that none of the measures we collect are
                        diagnostic! For instance, while we hope you'll be interested to learn that your child looked
                        70% of the time at videos where things fell up versus falling down, we won't be able to tell you
                        whether this means your child is going to be especially good at physics.
                     </p> <p>
                        We are generally able to provide general feedback (confirming that we got your video and will
                        be able to use it) within a week. To see this feedback, log in, then go to "Studies" and
                        select "Past Studies."

                    Not yet! Because we're measuring kids' looking patterns, we need a reasonably stable view of their eyes and a big enough screen that we can tell whether they're looking at the left or the right side of it. We're excited about the potential for touchscreen studies that allow us to observe infants and toddlers exploring, though!
