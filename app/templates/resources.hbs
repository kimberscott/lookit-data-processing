            <h3>Activities to try at home</h3>
            <p>
                Want to learn more about cognitive development? Here are some activities that may give you some insight into
                your own child's developing mind. Instead of studies our lab is running, these are "at home labs" for
                parents to try on their own--but please feel free to contact us with any questions!
            </p>

                <strong>Age range</strong>: 2.5 to 5 years
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What you'll need</strong>: For the "Maxi and the chocolate" story, any props you'd like
                (you can try drawing a picture or acting out the story). For the word-learning task, two containers
                to hold two objects your child doesn't know a name for (weird household objects like whisks or bike
                parts work great).
            </p>
            <p>
                In this lab, you'll see how your child thinks about what other people are thinking. Children under about
                four years of age tend to show a lot of trouble expressing what's going on in situations where someone else
                knows less than they do. They will often absolutely insist that everyone knows what they themselves know!

            <p>
                <strong>What you'll need</strong>: At least ten small objects your child can pick up, like pegs or Cheerios
            </p>

                <strong>Age range</strong>: 0 to 6 months
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What you'll need</strong>: A pacifier that your infant will suck on for about 15 minutes at a
                time and the operant conditioning web tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this lab, you'll let your baby control what sound is played by sucking faster or slower on a
                pacifier. We recommend starting by trying to observe his or her preference for hearing music or a
                heartbeat. <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~kimscott/instructions.html">Instructions</a>
