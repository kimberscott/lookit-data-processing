        <h3>Technical difficulties</h3>
        <p>To report any technical difficulties during participation, please contact our team by email at
            <a href="mailto:lookit-tech@mit.edu">lookit-tech@mit.edu</a>.

        <h3>Questions about the studies</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about the studies, please first check our FAQ. With any additional

        <h3>For researchers</h3>

        <p>
            We are committed to making Lookit a tool for all developmental researchers and to keeping the code
            open-source. You can view the current <a href="https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/lookit" target=_blank>Lookit</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/experimenter" target=_blank>Experimenter</a>, and
            <a href="https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/exp-addons" target=_blank>exp-addons</a> (specific
            frames for Lookit studies) codebases on github; <a href="https://github.com/kimberscott?tab=repositories" target=_blank>Kim's forks</a>
            may have more up-to-date versions of data analysis code.
        </p>

        <p>
            We're not quite ready to start hosting additional studies from other labs yet, but our partners at the
            Center for Open Science are actively developing functionality for multiple labs to create and post their
            own studies on Lookit. Although we aim for the platform to be as accessible as possible, some familiarity
            with programming basics will be helpful for researchers. An ideal skillset for creating your own studies
            would include basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for study creation; passing familiarity with
            the <a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.8.0/" target=_blank>Ember framework</a> used by Lookit and
            Experimenter; and python for data processing.
        </p>
        <p>
            For updates on the Lookit platform and discussions about collaboration opportunities, you can
            <a  href="http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/lookit-research" target=_blank>join the lookit-research
                email list</a>.  Several initial test studies of a prototype Lookit platform were completed in 2015;
            please email Kim Scott (kimscott@mit.edu) if you'd like in-press manuscripts describing the results.
