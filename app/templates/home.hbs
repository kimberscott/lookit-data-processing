                    Here at MIT's Early Childhood Cognition Lab, we're trying a new approach in developmental
                    psychology: bringing the experiments to you.

                <p>
                    Our online studies are quick and fun, and let you as a parent contribute to our collective
                    understanding of the fascinating phenomenon of children's learning. In some experiments
                    you'll step into the role of a researcher, asking your child questions or controlling
                    the experiment based on what he or she does.

                        Lookit is taking a break while our partners at the Center for Open Science work on
                        re-engineering
                        the site so it's easier for both parents and researchers to use. We're looking forward to
                        re-opening
                        the login system and starting up some new studies early this fall! Please contact lookit@mit.edu
